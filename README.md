# adaptive_patrol
Coverage/Patrolling  Ideas 1] Using voronoi distribution: Compute voronoi points as per probability distribution. Then,in iteration, change the probability distribution to get new voronoi points. Hence define the path for patrolling.  2] APF: Divide arena into fixed segments for each bot. Within each segment, vary potential field to make bot perform patrolling in that segment.
